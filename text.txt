If Bitcoin breaks and confirms above 65K and we get a real bull run, then I’ve outlined a Game Plan for the next
 few months. It isn’t so easy as buying quality alts and waiting. According to previous bull runs, the proper way
  to maximize profits is outlined in the Game Plan. The timeline and dates are just a rough guess of mine. Please
   don’t pay too much attention to it. Watching when the Bitcoin Dominance turns and reverses will be key. Before 
   it depends, I think buying the dips on the Bitcoin stocks will be the best strategy because most alts will be
    disappointing until Altcoin Season starts — i.e., when Bitcoin Dominance starts to turn down. And buying 
    bitcoin at this price doesn’t make much sense because even if it goes to 100K, that’s not even close to 
    doubling your money. Better off to accumulate Bitcoin during a real bear market. For now, Bitcoin stocks are 
    much more leveraged. And then try to time the entry into different sized altcoins. If done properly this will 
    compound profits rather than buy altcoins now and wait.
